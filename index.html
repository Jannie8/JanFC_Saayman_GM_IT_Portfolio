        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Jan Frederik Cronje Saayman (but just Jan is fine 😊). I am 21 years old
          and currently studying for my Bachelor of Computing in Software Engineering at
          Belgium Campus iTversity in Pretoria, South Africa. Since childhood, I’ve always
          been curious about technology — I was the kid with all the gadgets — but at the
          same time I’ve kept a strong love for the outdoors and nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside my studies, I founded Jan’s Tutoring, a business that started as a way
          to save money for travel but has since grown into a team offering both in-person
          and online tutoring across Pretoria. This venture not only allowed me to make my
          dream of traveling through Europe a reality, but also taught me valuable lessons
          about leadership, teamwork, and responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my love for Europe, my passion for learning, and my interest in global
          collaboration, I joined the Global Acting in IT minor. This program gives me the
          opportunity to expand my IT capabilities while working with international peers,
          learning from their knowledge, and experiencing their cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goals for this program are not only to strengthen my technical skills —
          particularly in prototyping and data visualization — but also to grow personally,
          by developing confidence in teamwork and building intercultural awareness.

            <!-- Online Week -->
            <article class="week-block">
              <h4>Online Week</h4>
              <div class="week-text">
                <h5>Null-Measurement</h5>
                <p>
                  Before the program began, I had some general knowledge about global IT topics such as IoT, AI, and data science, but I had never worked on a real-world project with such an international team. My understanding of Future Tech was mostly academic — I knew about immersive technologies and their applications in gaming, but not how they could connect to sustainability challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the online week, each day introduced us to different domains we would later explore in depth. On Monday, we met all the lecturers from the five participating universities. They explained the minor, introduced us to the Hartbeespoort Dam hyacinth project, and gave us our first taste of SDGs and water quality. Already here, I realised how little I actually knew about water quality monitoring and the scale of the hyacinth problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the week we also had introductory lectures:
                  <ul>
                    <li>UX Design (Monday)</li>
                    <li>Intercultural Competence (Tuesday)</li>
                    <li>Future Tech and IoT (Tuesday)</li>
                    <li>AI (Wednesday)</li>
                    <li>Personal Development (Wednesday)</li>
                    <li>Data Science (Thursday)</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each session deepened my vision of how these technologies could connect to our project. For example, before Tuesday I never considered IoT sensor networks as a way to manage ecosystems, but by the end of the session I could already see how IoT could support real-time water quality monitoring at Hartbeespoort.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the end of the online week, my initial vision of technology had shifted: Future Tech is not just about tools and gadgets — it is about combining innovation with sustainability and working together across borders to make an impact.
                </p>

                <h5>Project Contribution</h5>
                <p>
                 This was also the week when our project teams were formed. I was assigned to a group with Jana (Austria), Tamerlan (Belgium), and Georgi (Netherlands). We quickly connected and named ourselves Four Elements: Jana as Earth, Tamerlan as Water, Georgi as Air, and me as Fire. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our first assignment was a team-building task: we had to get to know each other, create a brand identity, and present ourselves to the lecturers and peers. My personal contribution was to define our core values and team goals, making sure they reflected both our cultural diversity and our project ambitions. This role gave me the chance to take initiative early on and set a foundation for how we wanted to collaborate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, we spent time brainstorming how technologies like immersive tools, IoT, and AI might fit into the Hartbeespoort project. Although our ideas were rough at this stage, they laid the groundwork for the concepts we would develop in Eindhoven.
                </p>

                <h5>Cultural Awareness</h5>
                <p>
                  The online week was also my first real exposure to intercultural teamwork. We came from very different backgrounds and countries, and already small things like communication styles and pacing showed differences. During the Intercultural Competence workshop, we received scenarios and had to decide as a group which outcomes we preferred. These discussions revealed how values can differ across cultures — for example, some members leaned toward collective decision-making, while others pushed for efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Socially, we also began to build friendships despite working online. Even through screens, we found humor in our cultural quirks and started forming trust. This early bonding made me feel more confident about traveling abroad to meet my team in person.
                </p>

                <h5>Reflection – What? So What? Now What?</h5>
                <h6>What?</h6>
                <p>
                  The online week introduced us to the Global Minor program, the lecturers, and the Hartbeespoort Dam project. It also gave us a chance to form our international team and deliver our first group assignment. I took responsibility for defining our team’s values and goals, and I began exploring technologies like IoT, AR/VR, and AI in relation to environmental challenges.
                </p>
                <h6>So What?</h6>
                <p>
                  This week made me realise that while I had technical knowledge, I had limited experience in applying it to real-world sustainability issues. It also highlighted the importance of intercultural collaboration — even something as simple as defining team goals required careful listening and respect for differences. I started to see how Future Tech is not only about developing solutions but also about understanding people, cultures, and stakeholders.
                </p>
                <h6>Now What?</h6>
                <p>
                  Moving forward, I want to strengthen my skills in applying technology to sustainable contexts and practice turning abstract ideas into clear concepts. I will also continue to pay attention to cultural dynamics in my team, ensuring that everyone’s perspective is valued. This foundation will help me contribute more effectively to our project as we move into the in-person weeks in Eindhoven.

            <!-- Week 1 -->
            <article class="week-block">
              <h4>Week 1 – Arrival & First Impressions</h4>
              <div class="week-text">
                <h5>Null-Measurement</h5>
                <p>
                  When I first arrived in the Netherlands after a 16-hour flight with Musti, I felt both excited and nervous. I already knew from the online week that we would be working with immersive technologies like AR/VR, but I had little practical experience using them outside of theory. My early expectation was that these tools would only be useful for entertainment or games.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On Monday at Fontys, I experienced AR and VR equipment for the first time in a hands-on way. We tested headsets, explored simple scenarios, and were challenged to think about how immersive tech could help in our project. This completely changed my view. I realised immersive tools could simulate prototypes without building them physically — saving costs, time, and even environmental impact. This was a shift in my vision of technology: Future Tech can be practical and impactful when applied in real contexts like Hartbeespoort Dam.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the end of Week 1, I had also developed more confidence in presenting. Although our AI-generated team videos didn’t work out perfectly, presenting the best two to our peers taught me that vision and effort are just as important as polish.
                </p>

                <h5>Project Contribution</h5>
                <p>
                  Our first in-person task as Four Elements was to present ourselves as a team. My role was contributing to the concept for our AI video and helping with the presentation itself. Even though we faced setbacks in generating some of the content, we confidently showed our results.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later in the week, Ferry led a design thinking workshop on the question: Should AI robots be taxed? As a team, we researched the topic, built arguments, and designed a prototype mobile app where people could vote on the issue. I helped define how the app would work and participated in presenting our findings. This exercise gave me an early opportunity to connect technology, society, and governance — a theme that would follow through the rest of the minor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the Hartbeespoort project itself, we began researching which technologies might form the basis of our solution. I took responsibility for exploring IoT sensor networks, looking at how they could be applied to water quality monitoring and stakeholder needs. My research contributed to our discussions about which technologies would be most realistic and impactful for our context.
                </p>

                <h5>Cultural Awareness</h5>
                <p>
                  From the very beginning, cultural differences shaped our experience. Everyone in my team spoke English, but some struggled with fluency, which sometimes created small misunderstandings. We quickly learned to slow down, repeat ideas, and check for clarity. In Samuil’s Intercultural Competence workshop, we worked through scenarios where our choices revealed our cultural values. It was eye-opening to see how different cultures prioritized collaboration, efficiency, or fairness.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Beyond the classroom, Eindhoven itself became part of my intercultural learning. On the first day, we had lunch at the Fontys cafeteria and later visited Hubble, a student pub, where we started bonding as a global cohort. That same week, I also joined classmates for a night of pool at Stratumseind, explored the city, and even joined a kickboxing class offered across the street from our hostel. These spontaneous experiences showed me how valuable social spaces are for building trust and friendships in an international setting. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of my favourite cultural discoveries was at the community lunch on Thursday, where I learned that Dutch people love chocolate sprinkles on bread. I tried it with chocolate spread underneath — chocolate on chocolate — and loved it. Small things like this made me feel immersed in local traditions while bonding with peers.
                </p>

                <h5>Reflection – What? So What? Now What?</h5>
                <h6>What?</h6>
                <p>
                  This week was my first time meeting my team in person, experimenting with AR/VR, and contributing to our early project work. I helped shape our AI video presentation, contributed to our design thinking prototype, and began researching IoT sensor networks for the Hartbeespoort project. Outside of class, I experienced Dutch food, culture, and social life, while also bonding with my international teammates.
                </p>
                <h6>So What?</h6>
                <p>
                  These activities reshaped my understanding of immersive technologies — they are not only for gaming but also powerful for simulating prototypes. I also realised that early failures (like our imperfect AI videos) are part of the process, and confidence in presentation matters just as much as the outcome. Intercultural activities highlighted that effective teamwork requires patience, clarity, and respect for different values. Socially, I learned that building strong relationships outside the classroom directly improves collaboration inside it.
                </p>
                <h6>Now What?</h6>
                <p>
                  Looking forward, I want to keep applying immersive technologies creatively in our project. I also aim to keep practicing presenting confidently, even when things don’t go as planned. Most importantly, I will continue embracing intercultural differences in communication styles, making sure everyone in the team feels included and understood.
                </p>

            <!-- Week 2 -->
            <article class="week-block">
              <h4>Week 2 – Deepening the Work</h4>
              <div class="week-text">
                <h5>Null-Measurement</h5>
                <p>
                  Coming into Week 2, I already had some new awareness of immersive technologies from the first week, but I was still unsure how they could be applied directly to a large-scale environmental challenge like Hartbeespoort Dam. I also knew very little about professional water management systems and how organisations in the Netherlands use technology for sustainability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This changed as the week progressed. The guest lecture from Aquality introduced us to a real-world IoT solution: an autonomous sensor boat that collects water quality data while navigating across a lake. This showed me how IoT could be combined with mapping to deliver practical, visual insights to stakeholders. Similarly, our visit to Enversed VR demonstrated how AR and VR can support industries beyond entertainment. I realised that immersive simulations could be used for public awareness campaigns or to train decision-makers before implementing costly interventions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By midweek, during our excursion to Amsterdam, I gained new insights into the cultural side of water management. At This is Holland, I learned how the Netherlands’ long history of managing water has shaped both its landscapes and its culture. This gave me context for understanding how Dutch stakeholders might approach our project. My vision of Future Tech expanded to include not just innovation and prototypes, but also the heritage and cultural values that shape how solutions are received and used.
                </p>

                <h5>Project Contribution</h5>
                <p>
                  This week was heavily focused on developing our project concepts. With Maike’s guidance, we identified our primary stakeholders and wrote three problem statements for each. We then brainstormed potential solutions, categorising them into tech, human, and data approaches. My contribution included researching case studies on IoT sensor networks and exploring how they could provide real-time dashboards of water quality. This research fed directly into our later group concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During Ferry’s design process workshop, we used prompt cards like sound and rolling to inspire out-of-the-box ideas. Our team created a virtual Hartbeespoort map where pollution increased when people made noise (sound input) and was cleaned when a ball was rolled (rolling interaction). We added IoT sensors as part of the design, linking the concept back to our project. I actively contributed to this brainstorming by suggesting ways to connect the inputs and outputs, ensuring the game not only entertained but also raised awareness about the dam’s condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the week, we worked on refining three potential concepts. My role was to provide technical insights into which IoT approaches were feasible, while also contributing to the design of visual posters for our Monday presentation the following week.
                </p>

                <h5>Cultural Awareness</h5>
                <p>
                  This week gave me several opportunities to experience Dutch culture and deepen my intercultural understanding.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>Community Lunch:</b> I noticed again how food plays a central role in Dutch culture and how sharing a simple meal brought the international group closer together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Amsterdam Excursion:</b> The This is Holland experience was unforgettable. Flying over the Netherlands in motion seats while feeling wind, mist, and even the smell of tulip fields made me appreciate the Dutch identity as a water nation. Talking to Dutch students afterwards, I realised even they learned new things about their own history. Later, the canal cruise showed us the city’s architecture and gave us a chance to connect socially while reflecting on what we had learned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Intercultural Competence class with Samuil:</b> This session focused on non-verbal communication. I learned that gestures, hand signals, and even facial expressions can have very different meanings in different countries. This made me more conscious of how I communicate in an international group.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Socially, I also bonded more with classmates outside of the classroom. Whether at the hostel bar, exploring Amsterdam’s nightlife, or simply talking with my team, I grew more comfortable navigating intercultural friendships. These experiences reminded me that international collaboration is not just about formal teamwork — it’s about understanding each other as people.

                <h5>Reflection – What? So What? Now What?</h5>
                <h6>What?</h6>
                <p>
                  In Week 2, I attended guest lectures (Aquality, Enversed), joined an excursion to Amsterdam, participated in intercultural classes, and worked with my team to develop three concept ideas for our project. My personal contributions included researching IoT networks, helping design creative concepts during workshops, and preparing materials for our concept posters.
                </p>
                <h6>So What?</h6>
                <p>
                  These activities gave me a clearer picture of how immersive and IoT technologies can be applied in environmental contexts. The Aquality case showed me how water quality monitoring is already being implemented practically, while Enversed revealed how immersive experiences can be used for education and awareness. The Amsterdam excursion deepened my cultural appreciation of Dutch water management, making me reflect on how heritage shapes technology adoption. On a personal level, I learned that non-verbal communication matters just as much as spoken language in international groups.
                </p>
                <h6>Now What?</h6>
                <p>
                  Going forward, I will build on these lessons by focusing my contributions on practical IoT implementations that align with stakeholder needs. I also want to continue practicing cultural sensitivity, especially by being mindful of non-verbal signals in meetings. Finally, I aim to help our team refine one concept that balances innovation with feasibility, ensuring that our project can make a real impact at Hartbeespoort Dam.

            <!-- Week 3 -->
            <article class="week-block">
              <h4>Week 3 – From Concepts to Final Direction</h4>
              <div class="week-text">
                <h5>Null-Measurement</h5>
                <p>
                  At the start of Week 3, I knew more about immersive technologies and IoT applications than when I arrived in the Netherlands, but I still lacked confidence in translating multiple ideas into a single, strong project concept. I also had limited experience presenting detailed design concepts to an international audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This week focused on refining and presenting our ideas. On Monday morning, our team presented three concept posters to Maike and our peers. We received valuable feedback that helped us see the strengths and weaknesses of each idea. For example, our AR sensor testbed concept was praised for its practicality, while our awareness game needed clearer outcomes beyond entertainment. This session showed me how much I still had to learn about evaluating concepts critically, not just generating them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the end of the week, I realised that my vision of technology had become sharper: Future Tech is not just about creativity, but about balancing innovation with feasibility and stakeholder value.
                </p>

                <h5>Project Contribution</h5>
                <p>
                  This week, most of my work revolved around finalising concepts and preparing our project plan.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>Concept Posters & Presentation (Monday):</b> I contributed research and text for the IoT-driven concept and helped prepare the visuals. During the presentation, I explained how sensor networks could support continuous monitoring at Hartbeespoort Dam.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Feedback Integration:</b> After the feedback session, I worked with the team to identify which elements of the three concepts could be combined into a stronger direction. My technical insights helped narrow the focus on IoT monitoring combined with public engagement through immersive tools.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Project Plan & Stakeholder Journey (midweek):</b> Together we developed a plan that included stakeholder needs, technology selection, and user profiles. I focused on the stakeholder analysis and helped draft user scenarios showing how authorities and citizens would interact with our solution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Ferry’s Design Workshop (Monday afternoon):</b> In this exercise, we role-played as designers and users to prototype solutions under constraints. I took the role of the designer in one round, using sticky notes and symbols to guide my “users” without words. This helped me experience the challenges of clear communication in design.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <h5>Cultural Awareness</h5>
                <p>
                  Week 3 also deepened my intercultural experience, both inside and outside the classroom.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>Feedback Sessions:</b> Presenting to an international audience showed me that people from different cultures evaluate ideas differently. Some valued creativity, while others focused on feasibility. This diversity helped me see our project through multiple lenses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Social Activities:</b> One of the highlights was a house party at an Airbnb hosted by Alexandra, Jana, and Josephine. I taught some of my peers sokkie (a South African partner dance) and the Timber line dance. It was a special moment of cultural exchange, where I could share a piece of home while also learning more about European social traditions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Everyday Interactions:</b> By Week 3, we were no longer strangers but friends. Simple routines — lunch at Bagels and Juice, drinks at Blue Collar, chats with hostel staff — became opportunities for intercultural learning. I learned that trust and friendship grow naturally when you share daily life, not just formal assignments.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These experiences reminded me that intercultural collaboration is about mutual exchange: not only learning about others but also contributing my own culture to the group.
                </p>

                <h5>Reflection – What? So What? Now What?</h5>
                <h6>What?</h6>
                <p>
                  In Week 3, we presented our three concepts, received feedback, and worked on finalising a single project direction. I contributed technical research on IoT sensor networks, stakeholder analysis, and presentation materials. I also participated in design workshops and team planning sessions. Outside of class, I shared South African culture with peers while experiencing new aspects of Dutch and European life.
                </p>
                <h6>So What?</h6>
                <p>
                  This week taught me the importance of evaluating and refining ideas, not just generating them. The feedback we received helped me see that innovation must always be paired with feasibility. I also realised that intercultural collaboration becomes richer when you actively share your own culture — whether through dance, food, or conversation — instead of only observing others.
                </p>
                <h6>Now What?</h6>
                <p>
                  Moving forward, I will focus on helping my team implement our final concept with a balance of creativity and practicality. I also want to carry forward the lesson that cultural exchange is two-sided: by contributing my perspective and traditions, I help build stronger, more genuine connections. These skills — critical evaluation and intercultural exchange — will be vital as we continue the minor in the next countries.
